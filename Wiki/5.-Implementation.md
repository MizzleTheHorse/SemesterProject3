Selected important implementation features from the different parts of the system is described in this section.

## API

To allow access to get and add audio files from the file system and database, an API is set up to handle communication with other subsystems.

For supplying these functionalities, different endpoints were set up as follows;
| Method | Endpoint | Request body | Response data | Description |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| GET | /get_track | { <br>ID: ‘song ID’ <br>} | <br>{ <br>URL: ‘Path to mp3’ <br><br>OR <br><br>message ‘error’ <br>} | Requesting an URL to the corresponding ID. The <br>response is an URL to the mp3 or returns an error. |
| GET | /add_youtube | { <br>URL: ‘YouTube ID’ <br>} | { <br>message: ‘success’ <br><br>OR <br><br>message ‘error’ <br>} | Requesting to add a sound file to the system <br>requires a URL from YouTube. <br>The response is either successful or returns an <br>error. |
| POST | /add_custom | { <br>file: ‘mp3’ <br>file: ‘PNG’ <br>JSON: ‘metadata’ <br>} | { <br>message: ‘success’ <br><br>OR <br><br>message ‘error’ <br>} | Requesting to add a sound file to the system <br>requires an mp3 file and JSON with metadata and <br>optional artwork file. The response is either <br>successful or returns an error. |
| POST | /delete_track | { <br>ID: ‘track ID’ <br>} | { <br>message: ‘success’ <br><br>OR <br><br>message ‘error’ <br>} | Requesting to delete a sound file from the <br>system requires the corresponding ID. <br>The response will be either successful or return <br>an error. |
| GET | /get_metadata | { <br>ID: ‘track ID’ <br>} | { <br>JSON ’metadata’ <br><br>OR <br><br>message ‘error’ <br>} | Requesting metadata from a given track ID will <br>return the JSON object for that track or return <br>an error. |
| GET | /get_all_tracks | { <br>Request <br>} | { <br>JSON ‘List of ID’s’ <br>} | Requesting to get all tracks in the system returns <br>a JSON object containing the ID’s for all tracks <br>currently in the system. |

## Frontend

Two web pages to the system are provided, one for adding YouTube audio and one for adding custom audio. Javascript fetch API is used for sending POST requests. The page for adding YouTube audio contains an input field for a YouTube URL which on submit is posted to the endpoint: “/add_youtube”. The page for adding custom audio is a form with input fields for the required metadata, audio and artwork file upload. The submit is handled by a script that converts the metadata to a JSON object before sending it along with the files with a POST request to the endpoint: “/add_custom”. The frontend is independent of the backend: as long as you contact the API endpoints the frontend service is replaceable.

## System Logic

The system logic component consists of a domain controller, a metadata class and an audio manager for custom audio and downloaded audio from youtube. In this section some individual methods are described, an overview of the system logic can be seen in the [class diagram](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/4.-Design#uml-class-diagram) in section 4.

#### Domain controller

The domain controller is used as an interface connecting all the logic from the system and makes it available for the API to use. It forwards the method calls to the audioManager which is in charge of storing and retrieving YouTube and custom audio. The domain controller uses the persistence controller to delete files and to retrieve URLs of stored audio. The advantage of having a central controller is that the API only needs to contact one class to provide its functionality. It supports maintainability, as long as methods in the domain controller are not changed, it's possible to change the implementation of methods in the other classes.

#### Metadata class

The metadata class handles the conversion of metadata retrieved from YouTube and custom uploaded audio into a JSON object. It creates a metadata object from YouTube or custom audio JSON files and takes only the relevant attributes which it parses to a new JSON object. An example is the parse_from_custom_audio_json method see code snippet [5.1](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#51-parse_from_custom_audio-method), where a metadata object is created. The formdata is converted into a python dictionary and then added to the attributes of the Metadata object. Finally a timestamp is added and the JSON returned.

###### _5.1: parse_from_custom_audio method_

```
def parse_from_custom_audio_json(self, json_formdata, audio_id, duration, artwork_url, bitrate):
   
   metadata = Metadata() # creating empty metadata object
   data = json.loads(json_formdata) #convert json_formdata to dict

   #add attributes to metadata object
   metadata.audio_id = audio_id
   metadata.name = data['name']
   metadata.artist = data['artist']
   .
   .
   metadata.created_at = str(datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"))

   return metadata.parse_to_json()
```

The equivalent method for YouTube, parse_from_youtube_json, works the same way but the values are extracted from the downloaded YouTube JSON file.

This solution ensures that all metadata is stored in a uniform way in the system, regardless of which method it’s added by. It also assures that no unused metadata is stored e.g. video format in YouTube audio.

#### Custom_audio_controller

The custom_audio_controller is responsible for handling custom audio added from the user. En essential method is the store_mp3 method as seen in codesnippet [5.2](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#52-store_mp3-method-in-customaudio-class), which stores the audiofile saved temporarily on the local filesystem on the fileserver. The temporary file is afterwards deleted. In the first try block it gets the path of the “temp” folder and saves it as a string in the local_path variable. The method “storeAudio'' is then called on the persistence controller. If successfully stored, the local file from the temp folder is deleted. If any exception occurs an error message is printed and a status code of 500 is returned. This method is an example of custom_audio_controller contacting the persistence controller and handling the response returned in the success variable as described in the  [Sequence diagram U05.](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/4.-Design#sequence-diagram-for-u05-add-custom-audio)

###### 5.2: store_mp3 method in CustomAudio class

```plaintext
def store_mp3(self, filename):
   try:
       local_path = os.getcwd() + '/audioManager/temp/temp/'
       success = self.persistence.storeAudio(local_path + filename, filename)

       # handle response
       if success:
           try:
               os.remove(local_path + filename)  # delete local tmp file
           except Exception as e:
               print("error: local file not deleted\n" + str(e))
       else:
           return 'error 500: internal server error'
   except Exception:
```

The post_metadata method in codesnippet [5.3](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#53-post_metadata-method-in-customaudio-class) has the functionality to send metadata to another service in the system. It posts the JSON provided to the endpoint specified in the method call. It returns a response corresponding to whether the transfer succeeded or not, which can then be used to either keep the file saved in the filesystem, or delete it to avoid inconsistency in the system.

###### 5.3: post_metadata method in CustomAudio class

```plaintext
def post_metadata(self, metadata_json, endpoint_url):
   # send metadata_json via an HTTP request to selected endpoint
   response = requests.post(endpoint_url, json=metadata_json)

   if response.ok:
       return "metadata successfully send!"
   else:
       return "error: " + response.reason
```

#### Ytdlcontroller

Ytdlcontroller is used for downloading audio and metadata from YouTube. The yt_dlp options are set to specify the local folder and filename and postprocessing is set to extract audio as an mp3 file with a bitrate of 126 kbps. See codesnippet [5.4](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#54-ydl_opts-attribute-from-youtubeaudiodl-class)

###### 5.4: ydl_opts attribute from YoutubeAudioDL class

```plaintext
ydl_opts = {
   'format': 'bestaudio/best',
   'clean_infojson': True,
   'outtmpl': os.getcwd() + '/audioManager/temp/temp' '/YT_%(id)s.%(ext)s',
   'postprocessors': [{
       'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
       'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
       'preferredquality': '126',
   }], }
```

To store audio from YouTube the store_mp3 method is called, see codesnippet [5.5](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#55-store_mp3-method-in-customaudio-class)[.](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#55-store_mp3-method-in-customaudio-class_) The method downloads the audio from youtube using the options specified above in codesnippet [5.4](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#54-ydl_opts-attribute-from-youtubeaudiodl-class). The storage of the locally stored audio file follows the same procedure as with custom audio, see codesnippet [5.2](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#52-store_mp3-method-in-customaudio-class).

###### 5.5: store_mp3 method in CustomAudio class

```plaintext
def store_mp3(self, youtube_id):
   id = [youtube_id]
   try:
       # Download mp3
       with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(self.ydl_opts) as ydl:
           ydl.download(id)
.
.
.
```

To retrieve JSON data from YouTube the get_json method is used. It works the same way as store_mp3 method, but passes the data to the metadata class to extract the relevant data from the YouTube JSON, before it is stored in the system.

## Persistence Logic

The persistence controller contains methods for storing and deleting audio and artwork. It handles the connection with the file server, and contains the information acquired to connect to the server. The library ftplib is used for handling the ftp requests.

The variables defining the access parameters are defined in the top of the class. This ensures high maintainability, as you only have to change the parameters in one location in case the audio needs to be saved elsewhere.

In the storeAudio method in code snippet [5.6](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#56-storeaudio-in-persistence-controller-class), in the try section, a file is opened from the local file path, “rb” meaning read binary. In the next line the audio file is sent to the server at the location root/audioroot/fileNameOnServer. Where root and audioroot are attributes of the Persistence Controller class and the fileNameOnServer specified in the method call. True is returned to indicate the audio has been successfully stored. If any errors occur, they are caught in the except section, which prints an error message and returns false, to indicate the storage was unsuccessful. In both cases the finally block is executed to close the file. This relates to the sequence diagrams stating that the method must report whether or not it’s executed successfully.

###### 5.6: storeAudio in Persistence Controller Class

```plaintext
def storeAudio(self, localFilePath, fileNameOnServer):

   file = None
   try:
       file = open(localFilePath, "rb")  # open file to send
       self.ftp.storbinary('STOR ' + '/' + self.root + '/' + self.audioroot + '/' + fileNameOnServer, file)  # send the file
       return True

   except ftplib.all_errors as e:
       print('Ftp fail -> ', e)
       return False

   finally:
       file.close()
```

The storeArtwork method works the same way, but with a different destination folder on the file server defined in the artworkroot attribute.

The getAudio method in codesnippet [5.7](https://gitlab.sdu.dk/semester-project-e2021/team-09/media-acquisition/-/wikis/5.-Implementation#codesnippet-57-getaudio-in-persistence-controller-class), is for retrieving an URL from the ID parsed to the method. It calls the method checkIfExist(id) to see if the requested ID exists in the system and if it does, a string with the URL to the location is returned, constructed from the parameters set in the Persistence Controller class.

###### 5.7: getAudio in Persistence Controller Class

```plaintext
def getAudio(self, id):
   if (self.checkIfExist(id)):
       return 'http://' + self.domain + '/' + self.root + '/' + self.audioroot + '/' + id + '.mp3'
   else:
       return None
```
