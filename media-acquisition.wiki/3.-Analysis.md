An analysis is done to extract the requirements that form the base of the system from the overall requirement for this sub-system. This is accomplished by investigating existing solutions, best practices and by a use-case analysis.

### **<span dir="">1.1 File handling</span>** 

The project description states a need for a solution for adding and retrieving audio files to and from the system. Therefore, this sub-part of the system should download and store audio files added from YouTube or by users as original work. Metadata corresponding to these audio files should also be stored, for other teams to use our service, and to recover metadata in case of inconsistency with other services.

### **<span dir="">1.2 Interface design</span>**<span dir=""> </span>

The design of the user interface for adding audio files should be simple and intuitive. Users of the system will typically be experienced with other similar systems such as YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud and YouTube to MP3 converters. Therefore it is a good idea for this system to have similar features: Eg. uploading multiple files at once and uploading meta-data along with the file. Other features, which the users are accustomed to, could be searching for specific YouTube videos and using pre-made playlists on YouTube. These features serve to make the system user-friendly and intuitive.

### **<span dir="">1.3 Communication</span>**

As this project is a sub-system of a bigger application it should be possible for the system to communicate with other subsystems. This communication entails the transfer of audio files and metadata to other subsystems. Handling of the acquired data should be outsourced to other subsystems, acquiring separation of concern. This communication will be exposed through a REST API, as it is an industry standard, soit will make our system accessible without exposing the system logic.

### **<span dir="">1.4 Storage</span>**

**<span dir="">Storage type</span>**

According to Maxim Orlov [(maximorlov.com, Visited on 10.10.2021)](https://maximorlov.com/why-storing-files-database-bad-practice/), best practices for storing a big quantity of large files is storing them in a file system. In order to query the metadata, a relational database is used, as it is the fast way to retrieve the information. The database will store metadata as a JSON file, with the id corresponding to the audio file. This is an optimal solution, as filesystems are optimized for storing, retrieving and indexing files, and a relational database for querying metadata.

**Scaling**

As it is expected that the user base of the service should be able to scale to millions within the first two years, the storage should be able to scale as needed. If not scalable, it’s not possible to meet expectations of availability for the system, which is crucial to the users. The response time will become slow or in the worst case the service will become unavailable.

**<span dir="">Data verification</span>**

The data storage should be as optimized as possible to avoid problems with unnecessary data in the database. Methods to accomplish this could be:

- Detecting if a specific audio file already exists in the system.
- Verifying files to make sure they aren’t corrupt. Corrupted audio files will have a structure not expected by the system and will not be playable.
- Verifying that an upload from a personal computer is no bigger than 128GB, as this is also the limit on YouTube.
- The the system should verify that files added contain audio files.

**<span dir="">Audioformat</span>**

Audio is saved in mp3 format with a bitrate of 126 kbps - equivalent to the highest possible audio quality in YouTube. [(Kevin Arrows, Visited on 10.10.2021)](https://appuals.com/why-converting-youtube-to-320kbps-mp3-is-a-waste-of-time/)

### **<span dir="">1.5 Security</span>**

It is vital to restrict access to the storage system of audio files. Otherwise it can pose a serious threat regarding the integrity of data, as well as misuse of the storage system. This sub-system relies heavily on the work of the Connection Security sub-system to ensure that no unauthorized access is possible.

The different actors of the system need to have clearly defined constraints on their access rights to the system: Admin(s) should have full CRUD access to everything in the file system, whereas registered users should only have CRUD access to their own submitted files.

There should be a report function for each uploaded audio file, so the moderator can know which audio files to remove from the system. This is necessary to uphold a certain quality of the content of the system as it could be flooded with non music files and inappropriate content.

## **Use-case analysis**

To retrieve the functional requirements to the system an use case analysis is conducted including a use case diagram, actor and use case description and a detailed description of selected core use cases.

### **Use Case Diagram**

![use-case_diagram_2_-_cropped](uploads/6ee954d1fb57bdded45dc6855c03b07a/use-case_diagram_2_-_cropped.png)

### **List of Actors**

The primary actors are:

* A registered user with privileges to add audio to the system, update and delete own data.
* A moderator has access to all data, and needs to verify all data in the system.
* The streaming system, which saves the added audio files in the system.

A Secondary actor is the Meta-data System that handles storage of meta-data.
